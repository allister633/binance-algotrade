## Requirements

[Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org)

```bash
git clone git@github.com:allister633/binance-algotrade.git
cd binance-algotrade
git checkout develop
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Analyse

Analyse.py is a graphical static market analysis tool that allows to visualise the closing prices of a pair with different indicators. It also displays buy and sell signals of available strategies. The goal is to visualise and spot different trends to develop or adjust an automated trading strategy for live usage.

This tool relies on [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/) for data visualisation. It can be installed using pip command :

```bash
pip install plotly
```

Analyse.py uses data stored in CSV file generated by klines.py. Klines.py retrieves last open-high-low-close data for a pair with a given interval. Let's get last prices for Bitcoin compared to Thether with a 15m interval :

```bash
python klines.py BTCUSDT --interval 15m
```

This will generate a BTCUSDT_15m.csv file in the data folder.

Now let's visualise this prices with two exponential moving averages of 9 and 21 periods, and a simple strategy that buys currency when the 9 EMA crosses the 21 EMA from below.

```bash
python analyse.py data/BTCUSDT_15m.csv --ema 9 21 --strategy 1 9 21
```

This should open a tab in your navigator with the graph.
